# Bivariate distributions connected with the continuous mixture and discrete  marginals
We implement various algorithms useful for BEG, BGG, GMDP, BLG  models. Testing for exponentiality versus Pareto distribution is also implemented. Others include random variable simulation, quantiles, and marginals.
