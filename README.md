# Bivariate distributions connected with the continuous mixture and discrete  marginals
These work concerns models with stochastic representation (X, N) where is N is a discrete distribution on positive integers and X is the random sums of N independent/dependent {Xi}s.  

In the above contest, several models have been developed, which includes bivariate distribution with exponential and geometric marginals (BEG law) by Kozubowski and Panorska (2005), bivariate gamma-geometric law (BGG) by Barreto-Souza W. (2012), a bivariate distribution with Lomax and geometric margins (BLG) by Arendarczyk et al (2018), a bivariate distribution with gamma mixture and discrete Pareto margin (GMDP) Amponsah et al.  etc.

We implement various algorithms useful for BEG, BGG, GMDP, BLG, etc.  models. Testing for exponentiality versus Pareto distribution is also implemented ( See Kozubowski et al, 2008). Others include random variable simulation, quantiles, marginals, and others. The link to the various articles is listed below.
